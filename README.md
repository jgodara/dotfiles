# My Dotfiles

This repo has my bins, configs, and custom scripts that I use.
Just clone this repo and put the files in appropriate directories.


To be used with [EAST](https://github.com/eivor-io/east).

## NOTES

My mutt is configured with [LukeSmithxyz](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/)'s [Mutt Wizard](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/mutt-wizard).

If you use Arch btw, you can do `yay -S mutt-wizard-git`.
